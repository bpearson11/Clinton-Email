# Initial Findings

My initial finding after analyzing cluster C1 is the only thing tying it together was talk of Bengazhi, but in the subclusters, there were several common themes, including foreign policy, national security, and the U.S. 2012 presidential election [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). My analsis of one subcluster revealed to me Libya's President Mohammed Ussef el Magariaf believed  if Libya could not stop the militants who attacked Bengazhi, it convince foreing businesses the country was unstable, and that many of the Islamic militants were being funded by al Qaeda. My examination of a second subcluster revealed Hillary's inner circle was concerned about the effect Bengazhi would have on U.S. policy in Libay, especially projects America had already begun implementing in the country. My analysis of a third revealed how eager the GOP was to use it in the election (one Romney advisor called it a gift) and the confusion about of Clinton's supporters about why it could not be consigned to the "sad and sealed file of Americans killed abroad in dangerous line of duty" [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). Given I learned this information from a cluster - about 20 emails out of 30,000 - there is much more that could be learned if scholars chose to analyze the data further; additional analysis might reveal, perhaps, the effect Bengazhi had on Libya's economy, including U.S. invesment. 

However, analyzing the subject in depth would absolutely need a larger team - this is not a project one person can tackle - and they would need to have knowledge of digital techniques, in some capacity. As I did the researcher on my own, I was only able to look at a single cluster; a larger team, in contrast, could analyze a large section of Clinton's emails. Scholars will also need technical expertise, since my limited abilities did hamper my ability to analyze data by preventing me from using hierarchical clustering programs that would have aided my project. Finally, scholars will need better technology - I had to limit the size of the file I ran on Orange so my computer could process it; scholars with technology more powerful than what I have could do higher quality quality research by analyzing more in depth, or analyzing a wider dataset.

This is where you where you discuss any (initial) conclusions you have come to. This is also a natural place to put any and all visualizations that you come up with. In fact, this is where you tell the reader what it is you discovered. You can use the first person if that helps you discuss the process. This is where you both describe to the reader what they are looking at (if they are looking at a visualization) and, most importantly, what your interpretation of the results is.



If your project was less visualization-centric, this is where you at least explain in plain words what you learned through the process of non-visual analysis. For example, if you used text mining not for visualization purposes, but to help you manually find interesting threads of conversation in a body of documents.

You should also make sure to be a cautious scholar, and to think about the limitations of what the visualizations can actually tell you. As indicated by the section name, you are **not** expected to make hard conclusions that upend serious historical debates. Rather, this is a place to explore what might be learned from visual exploration.

You must also comment on where you would go next. If these are initial findings, where do you think the best profit would be for any future attempts. This is also where you can talk about pitfalls that limited your ability to learn more about the topic. How might future projects overcome these difficulties?
