# Problems and Possibilities

This section serves as your sort-of conclusion/summary. Not a summary of the historical subject, but a summary of the process of the project itself. By discussing where you hit roadblocks and where you wish you could go if you had more time, you leave future individuals something to build on.

You should talk about where you group encountered the most difficulties. What was the hardest about scraping, or visualizing, or locating historiography? Did you have problems communicating or sharing files on GitHub?

The hardest thing for me while working on my project was getting Orange3 to analyze Clinton's emails on my computer. I had to download Orange on two computers before I was able to find one that would run Orange and let it analyze the data. After I downloaded Orange, I had to reduce the size of the CSV file from seventeen thousand to around three thousand emails because my computer was not powerful enough to run Orange on  such a large file.  Since the emails I chose were not chosen at random - I simply chose the first three thousand in the CSV file - the data is not representative, limiting the ability of myself and others to use it to learn about the entire dataset. 



What problems stopped you dead in the water? Did you have to change course mid-project to account for data that you could not get, or was not what you thought?

Moving on from problems, let's the reader on a positive note. What worked best, where did you think the strength of the project was? What were the most useful historical insights? What were the most useful tools?

Finally, think of future attempts to continue this line of research, whether by yourself or others. Where do you want to go with it. What areas do you think could be expanded easily? You can discuss what you wish you could have done but could not due to lack of time/skill/et.c. But, much more than that, what would you suggest would be the most useful thing(s) you think could actually be accomplished in the space of another semester?
