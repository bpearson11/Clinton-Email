This project consists of the author's analysis of Hillary Clinton's emails using Orange3's hierarchical clustering widget to group together similar emails. To allow the hierarchical clustering to work, the author first had to use Orange's "Bag of Words" widget to give the emails numerical value - in this case, how often specific words were used - and put it into the "Distances" widget to see how similar certain emails were. After running it through those widgets, the author analyzed cluster C1 - a set of emails about Bengahzi - to see what linked them together, finding that the reason they were linked together was the fact they all talked specifically about the attack in Bengahzi or Libya, but covered a range of topics. Some were about national security - such as who was behind the attack - while others were about the 2012 Presidential election; a significant number were about Republicans attempts to paint Obama as weak when it came to foreign policy by using Bengahzi.  

Replace this, putting the introduction/summary of your project here. Leave the credits in the bottom section, however.
