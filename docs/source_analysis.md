## Basic Source Information

* The source is located at [https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), consists of thousands of Clinton's emails, and is hosted by WikiLeaks, a [whistleblower organization](https://wikileaks.org/What-is-WikiLeaks.html). 



## Authorship

* According to WikiLeaks, on March 16, 2016, it designed an engine to search through the roughly 30,000 emails released by the State Dept. as PDFs, [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). These emails were released following a Freedom of Information Act request by Jason Leopold of Vice News [(Brennan and Reid, 2015)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-to-comply-with-court-order-on-hillary-clintons-emails/). Aside from that, however, WikiLeaks gives visitors no other information about the project - aside from that it lets users search by term or email ID number [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/).
