## Basic Source Information

* The source is located at [https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), consists of thousands of Clinton's emails, and is hosted by WikiLeaks, a [whistleblower organization](https://wikileaks.org/What-is-WikiLeaks.html). 



## Authorship

According to WikiLeaks, on March 16, 2016, it designed an engine to search through the roughly 30,000 emails released by the State Dept. as PDFs, [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). These emails were released following a Freedom of Information Act request by Jason Leopold of Vice News [(Brennan and Reid, 2015)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-to-comply-with-court-order-on-hillary-clintons-emails/). Aside from that, however, WikiLeaks gives visitors no other information about the project - aside from that it lets users search by term or email ID number [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/).



According to WikiLeaks, it wants to promote transparency to reduce corruption in government, business, and other institues [(WikiLeaks, 2011)](https://wikileaks.org/About.html). However, WikiLeaks founder and leader Julian Assange made comments in 2015 that suggest he wanted Hillary to lose the Presidential election, which means it is likely there was alterior motive in their construction of the dataset [(Currier and Lee, 2018)](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/).

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?


The emails reflect the views of Hillary Clinton and the people she is closest to - politically and otherwise, while their digitization reflects Julian Assange's anti-Clinton stance - the search engine faciliates a user's ability to sift through her emails and find details damaging to Clinton. However, in constrast to these individuals, Jason Leopold seems to have no motive in filing an FOIA then wanting to break a story.
