## Historical Background

Part of the historiography of text analysis is the "Gender, Race, and Nationality in Black Drama, 1950-2006: Mining Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters" [(Argamon et al., 2009)](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/3/2/000043/000043.html). The authors discuss their use of text analysis to test whether techniques can tell the difference between authors of different gender, race, and nationality. Though they were successful in their efforts, it was only after normalizing the data that the authors were able to use the techniques to determine author and character gender, putting distance between the text the authors fear limits the ability to interpret text with the tools. Argamon and his team point out focusing on only simple categories may prevent analysis of complex themes using text analysis or reinforce the biases of authors by "confirming" what they set out to prove.

Another part of the historiography of text analysis, which responds to "Gender," is Dr. Meehan's "Text Minding" [(Meehan, 2009)](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/3/2/000045/000045.html). Dr. Meehan agrees with Argamon and his compatriots technology may force sources into models so simple as to be worthless; however, unlike Argamon, Meehan states technology could aid research. If scholars familiarize themselves with technology and combine it with traditional tools, it could enable them to find its shortcomings and learn how to circumvent epistemological impediments posed by technology, just as Fredrick Douglas was able to overcome the binarity of slavery by familiarizing himself with and exploring how slavery advocates contrasted slaves with the free. 

The relevance of these articles to using text analysis on WikiLeaks' archive of Clintons' emails is scholars must be careful how they use tools, as it is unrealistic to believe imperfect people will create perfect tools, but the way for scholars to prevent themselves from being constrained is to educate themselves on how technology works(Aramon et al., 2009 and Meehan, 2009). As the author of this project and others become familiarize themselves with Orange3 and Voyant, they will be able to see the shorcomings of text analysis and digital techniques in general. A better understanding of technology, in turn, will allow scholars to find novel ways to analyze text, and possibly increase the breadth and depth of humanistic study. Therefore, projects such as researching Clinton's emails are useful, both because they allow learning about the material, and give shcolars opportunity to familiarize themselves with technology.

## Digital Background



You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
